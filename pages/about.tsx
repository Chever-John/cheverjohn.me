            I am a person who likes to think and have the habit of writing down
            what I think. Whether you can use tools or not is the key to
            distinguishing humans from animals, and whether you can believe or
            not is the key to determining a real human being. Therefore, this
            site aimed to record my deep thinking in some system architecture
            design, algorithms, or other things.

          <p>Yes, I also gave a presentation on this topic.</p>
          <p>
            Speaking at ApacheConAsia was a life-changing experience. I faced my
            fears and gave a meaningful presentation in front of a supportive
            audience.
