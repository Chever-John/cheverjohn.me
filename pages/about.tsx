        <h2>What I am going to do</h2>
        <p>
          I am a person who likes to think and have the habit of writing down
          what I think. Whether you can use tools or not is the key to
          distinguishing humans from animals, and whether you can believe or not
          is the key to determining a real human being. Therefore, this site
          aimed to record my deep thinking in some system architecture design,
          algorithms, or other things.
        </p>
        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, I work for a cross-border e-commerce company(SHEIN) with
          both challenges and potential and build distributed cloud-native
          architecture for them. I enjoy my current job and look forward to
          becoming a respected person in the future.{" "}
