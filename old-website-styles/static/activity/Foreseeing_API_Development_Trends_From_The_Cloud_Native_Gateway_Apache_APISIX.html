      <p>
        With the concept of cloud-native more impressive, 
        the development method using a native way based on 
        the cloud service we can call cloud-native architecture 
        now become the critical way to reduce costs and increase efficiency. 
        There is no hesitation in saying that traditional 
        microservice architectures are being “baptized” by 
        cloud-native technologies. Cloud-native gateway 
        is one of the representative technologies. 
        While ensuring the primary load balancing function, 
        it can also rely on its cloud-native attributes to 
        achieve tasks including but not limited to observability, 
        authentication, etc. By explaining the architectural 
        solution implementation of the cloud-native gateway, 
        we can foresee the future API development trend.
